General notes:

The relationship between w_a and w_p is:

w_p = w_a * (1 - a)/(a_p - a)

The Dark Energy Task Force (DETF) basically laid out the case for pursuing
dark energy. They proposed several things.

First, they proposed (or probably adopted?) a parametrization of a
time-varying w as

w = w_0 + (1-a)w_a

Which has the virtue that w=w_0 today - is simply a first order Taylor
expansion.

Of course we don't directly measure Lambda. What has actually been measured is
more subtle. We actually measure is a''(t) > 0. According to the Friedmann
acceleration equation,

a''(t) = -4piG/3 * (rho + 3*p) + lambda/3    (p. 27)

Now, the DETF point out that a''(t) > 0 could be explained by:

1.) dark energy - i.e. some component where w < -1/3
2.) cosmological constant
3.) modification to GR, standard cosmological model, etc.

However, I think a better (and probably more widespread) usage is that 1.) and
2.) are both dark energy, and 2.) is just a special case of 1.) (w=-1). This
does bring up a potentially important point which is that the observational
problem is not that we observe dark energy, but that we observe an
acceleration _for which an additional fluid component is one possible
explanation_.
